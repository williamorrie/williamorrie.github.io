title: "Visualising clusters of Northern Irelan Road Traffic Collisions (RTC's)"
---

### Idea
Using the open data that was collected for RTC Heatmap, create a cluster analysis in mapbox.

### Process 
1. Create a new branch on github
2. Create a new HTML page in new branch
3. Add mapbox boilerplate code for Heatmap
4. Update the data source to point to my RTC layer in mapbox

### Problems
1. Unable to test on mobile / GitHub.com as commits to new branch are not automatically published.
2. Original Heatmap layere were created in mapbox studio and published from there as a style, how do I reference the data in new map?
3. New post didn't appear on home page

### Solutions
1. Found this [article](https://automationpanda.com/2021/03/24/testing-github-pages-without-local-jekyll-setup/){:target="_blank} while researching something else. Repo Home Page > Settings > Options > Source
2. API?
3. New page did not have .md extension

### Results
1.
