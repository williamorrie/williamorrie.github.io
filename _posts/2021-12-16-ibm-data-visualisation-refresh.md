title: "Automatically refreshing IBM Data Analyst Capstone project"

### Idea
Spent some time last month using [Google Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/) to download, clean and prepare [N.I. GP prescription data](https://www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/gp-prescribing-data). I would now like to add the resulting Jupyter Notebook to this Github site. 

### Process 
GIYF!
This [post](http://www.kasimte.com/adding-and-including-jupyter-notebooks-as-jekyll-blog-posts) by [Kasim Te](http://www.kasimte.com/) provided a simple solution

### Problems
1. Incorrectly added the generated html file to "\_pages" subfoder on github when it should have been added to "\_posts"

### Resolutions
1. [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location) shows how easy it is to move files between folders.

### Results
A backdated github [post](https://williamorrie.github.io/2021/04/17/preparing-prescription-data-in-colabs.html) that displays the content of the colab page.
